### Purpose of the Sprint    
Last week, on November 30, 2018, UC San Diego Library Research Data Curation Program participated in the Top 10 FAIR Data Things Global Sprint.  The Sprint was organized by Library Carpentry, Australian Research Data Commons and the Research Data Alliance Libraries for Research Data Interest Group in collaboration with FOSTER Open Science, OpenAire, RDA Europe, Data Management Training Clearinghouse, California Digital Library, Dryad, and AARNet.  The purpose of the global sprint was to develop brief guides as standalone or self-paced training materials. These training materials will be available, as a part of the Library Carpentry lessons, for use by the research community to understand FAIR principles in different contexts, as well as some initial steps to consider for making their own data FAIR.
