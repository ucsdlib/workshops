## Introduction

There are many actions researchers can take to increase the openness and reproducibility of their work. Please join us for a workshop, hosted by the [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/), to learn easy, practical steps researchers can take to increase the reproducibility of their work. The workshop will be hands-on. Using example studies, attendees will actively participate in creating a reproducible project from start to finish.

## Topics

* Project documentation
* Version control
* Pre-Analysis plans
* Open source tools like the Center for Open Scienceâ€™s Open Science Framework to easily implement these concepts in a  scientific workflow

## Date

April 29, 2016 (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

## Location
SDSC

## Audience

All faculty, staff, and students across disciplines, who are engaged in quantitative research. Register here. The workshop does not require any specialized knowledge of programming. Participants will gain a foundation for incorporating reproducible, transparent practices into their current workflows.
