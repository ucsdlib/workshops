## Intro to R - 10/5

## Setup R and RStudio

This lesson assumes you have the R, RStudio software installed on your computer.

Please ensure you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your machine. This is important, as some packages used in the workshop may not install correctly (or at all) if R is not up to date.

R can be downloaded [here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).

RStudio is an environment for developing using R. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). You will need the Desktop version for your computer.


## Getting a headstart

If you are new to R and RStudio, you can familiarize yourself with some of the basic syntax and structure of R, take the free online R course from datacamp.com: https://www.datacamp.com/. You can also learn R from within R with a tutorial called [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/). Follow the instructions here http://swirlstats.com/students.html.

## Let's use R Notebook

R Notebooks are new feature of RStudio and are only available in version 1.0 or higher of RStudio. An R Notebook is an R Markdown document with chunks that can be executed independently and interactively, with output visible immediately beneath the input.
