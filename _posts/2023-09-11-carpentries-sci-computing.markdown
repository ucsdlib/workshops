## Introduction:

The UC Carpentries Fall Workshop Series aims to introduce researchers to basic concepts, skills, and tools in programming and data management. During this workshop, we will cover foundational R and Python coding, data management practices and tools, automation, and version control. This series is designed for novices and you do not need to have any previous knowledge of the topics that will be presented at the workshop. This is a free workshop.
