category: posts jupyter litpro
---

## Instructors

* Harrison Dekker, University of California, Berkeley (@vagrantscholar)
* Tim Dennis, University of California, San Diego (@jt14den)

## Audience:

* Librarians, programmers, openscience advocates

## Location 

* [ELAG 2016](http://elag2016.org/), Copenhagen

## Date/Time

* June 6, 2016. all day

## Expertise:

The material covered is most applicable to academic and science librarians, but could apply to
public librarians with an interest in promoting programming and/or ‘citizen science’.
Programming experience:

Some programming experience will be helpful, but the workshop will also benefit those with a
strong interest in learning Python.

## Description:

Consider the following quote: 
> “An article about computational results is advertising, not
scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that
produced the result.” - Claerbout and Karrenbach, Proceedings of the 62nd Annual International Meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysics. 1992

This quote highlights a central tenet of the open science movement, namely that researchers
doing computational work need to share their code and data to allow replication of their results
and to more clearly demonstrate their methods. But sharing is not yet commonplace, in part
due to technical impediments. Typical problems have to do with reproducing the computing
environment in which the code was used and include operating system dependencies, software
version incompatibilities, and dependencies on proprietary components.

Project Jupyter is an effort to provide a solution to these challenges by creating an opensource,
computational environment where text and code can be intermingled:

The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share
documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses
include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling,
machine learning and much more. (Source: [http://jupyter.org])

Numerous examples of Jupyter Notebooks now exist across the disciplines and in both research
and teaching. There are even examples of their usage in journalism. We contend that libraries
can and should play a role in promoting open science tools like Jupyter. Some potential roles
include.
