## Introduction

This workshop is geared to researchers wanting to use R for basic data manipulation and analysis. It will introduce participants to the basics of data tidying and manipulation (notably using tidyr & dplyr), how to set up data processing pipelines, and briefly cover working with a database. We will also cover ggplot2 and touch on ggvis for data visualization.  Some experience with R or attendance of the Intro to R course on 10/20 is required.
