## Introduction
“High-performance computing” supercomputers have been around for longer than some of their users today. The first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was setup in 1976 and was put in operation at Los Alamos National Laboratory. In the course of history, the design of supercomputers underwent several revolutions. Today, most universities and an increasing part of the industry in several domains exploit the computational power of clusters of interconnected servers.

These High-performance Computing (HPC) clusters are used for large scale data processing and data analysis, fine grained parallel calculations and simulations of ever increasing fidelity. This course material is meant to introduce learners to the core principles behind the using a HPC cluster, how to connect to it, how to dispatch jobs and retrieve their results, and how to program applications that can harness the full power of this machinery.
