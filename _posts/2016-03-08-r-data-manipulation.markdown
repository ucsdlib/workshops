## Introduction

This workshop is geared to researchers wanting to use R for basic data manipulation and analysis. It will introduce participants to the basics of data tidying and manipulation (notably using tidyr & dplyr), how to set up data processing pipelines, and briefly cover working with a database. We will be using a genomics dataset for this course.  This workshop is designed for novices, but we would like you to have some experience with R or have attended the Intro to R course on 3/7.

## Topics:

* Data Manipulation Using dplyr (subsetting, filtering, aggregating)
* Dataframe Manipulation with tidyr (reshaping data)

## Date
March 8, 2016 (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

## Location

Biomedical Library Building - Classroom 4

## Audience

All graduate students or researchers.

## Code Samples:

 * [dplyr 1](http://ucsdlib.github.io/workshops/dplyr.html)
 * [dplyr 2](http://ucsdlib.github.io/workshops/dc_dplyr.html)

### R

[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).

#### Windows

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

#### Mac OS X

Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

#### Linux

You can download the binary files for your distribution from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base and for Fedora run sudo yum install R). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).
